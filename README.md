About the project
=====================

Our project's visualization is divided into three distinct areas:
- Main Timeline - This area occupies the top of the visualization. This is the main visualization partition of
the tool and it provides information about e-mail relationships on a monthly basis.
- Secondary Timeline - Located on the left lower part of the visualization, the Secondary Timeline shows the same information as the main but on a daily basis.
- Topic Cloud - Like a typical tagcloud, this visualization has the purpose of showing the most discussed/distinctive topics present in e-mail subjects.

About the project Part II - A little history
=====================

This project was developed by me and Tiago Garcia while we were taking the "Personal Information Management and Visualization" course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.
As part of the course, we have written a small paper describing and praising our work. Later on, that paper was presented in the AVI'12 conference. You can check the final paper [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254647&preflayout=tabs).

About the technology
=====================

For this project we used:
- Python (2.7) - The backbone of the application, where it all happens. Literally.
- Cherrypy - A Minimalist Python Web Framework that allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. 
- jQuery / jQuery UI- For dealing with the client side scripts and UI.
- Protovis - A nice visualization toolkit that uses JavaScript and SVG for web-native visualizations.
