About the project
=====================

This project was developed by me and Tiago Garcia while we were taking the "Personal Information Management and Visualization" course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.
As part of the course, we have written a small paper describing and praising our works. Later on, that paper was presented in the AVI'12 conference. You can check the final paper [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254647&preflayout=tabs).
