Who Have I Been Talking To
=====================

"Who Have I Been Talking To" (aka WHIBTT) is a visualization of the users' email account that can provide insights about his/her relationships with others and how those relations have evolved over time.

About the project
=====================

Our project's visualization is divided into three distinct areas:
- Main Timeline - This area occupies the top of the visualization. This is the main visualization partition of
the tool and it provides information about e-mail relationships on a monthly basis.
- Secondary Timeline - Located on the left lower part of the visualization, the Secondary Timeline shows the same information as the main but on a daily basis.
- Topic Cloud - Like a typical tagcloud, this visualization has the purpose of showing the most discussed/distinctive topics present in e-mail subjects.

The project is considered closed (this means that we don't plan to work on it any longe) but with (already identified) improvement opportunities :)

For more information, I strongly recommend you to read the [full paper](docs/Final Papel.pdf)

About the project Part II - A little history
=====================

This project was developed by me and Tiago Garcia while we were taking the "Personal Information Management and Visualization" course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.
As part of the course, we have written a small paper describing and praising our work. Later on, that paper was presented in the AVI'12 conference. You can check the final paper [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254647&preflayout=tabs).

About the technology
=====================

For this project we used:
- Python (2.7) - The backbone of the application, where it all happens. Literally.
- Cherrypy - A Minimalist Python Web Framework that allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. 
- jQuery / jQuery UI- For dealing with the client side scripts and UI.
- Protovis - A nice visualization toolkit that uses JavaScript and SVG for web-native visualizations.

About using it
=====================

This project is just a proof of concept, a prototype. Issues such as performance, security, etc, were not taken into account. 
The objective was to show our idea through a simple and fast implementation with just a few weeks of analysis, development and tests.

Having said that, here are the steps you should follow to see it live:
1) Download and install Python 2.7. It may just work on other versions, but this "official" python version for this project

- Download and unzip this project to your computer (duh!)
- Run (double click) server.py at the root of the project. This will start a local websserver and automatically open a browser's window.
- Enter your email (gmail accounts only) and password and login.
- WHIBTT will now start indexing your email. Indexing all of your emails will take it's time but the application lets you see results with just a few emails indexed.
